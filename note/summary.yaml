    heading: "### Questions 

        Every day many people commute from Augsburg to Munich,
        and every week some traffic accidents happen on Autobahn 8.
        Which part of the highway is most dangerous? Which direction
        is more dangerous, driving to or returning from Munich? At
        what time? In what road condition? In order to make the
        investigation quick and intuitive, a dashboard is created so
        that one can compare the distributions of the accidents along
        A8 in different (combinations of) conditions."

    conclusion: "### Conclusion 

        1. There are a few obvious anomalies that one can quickly recognize. 

        - excessive accidents between **Sulzemoos and Odelzhausen** 
          on the **return trip** from Munich. 

        - excessive accidents between **Adelzhausen and Odelzshausen** 
          on the way **to go** to Munich. 

        - excessive accidents between **Sulzemoos and Dreieck MÃ¼nchen**
          on the way **to go** to Munich. 


        In either case, such excessive accidents are not seen on the
        route in the opposite direction. The tendency can be seen in
        all years that the data are collected. If we close up
        individual accident site, it seems the most of the accidents 
        happens on the passing lane. 


        2. There are more than 40,000 combinations of filtering, just
        counting the options that we picked up here. A quick web
        app/dashboard is a good option to perform **intuitive
        investigations**."

    what: "### What this App Does 

        1. The App uses the data 

        2. clean-up the data (the collections of data are slightly
        different each year).

        3. get the coordinate of A8 (up to and down from Munich)
        by 

        4. calculate the distances between an accident site and the A8
        up/down lanes to identify which lane (direction of road) the
        accident happens.

        5. use the data collected on 3. convert the latitudes and the
        longitude of the accident sites as one dimensional distance,
        i.e., distance from the entrance (in our case Zusmarshausen)
        along A8.

        6. Aggregated the data as histogram, heat map, ad bar chart. 

        7. Show the figures and the maps on a dashboard using streamlit. 
           Add control via streamlit interface.  

        8. Deploy the App on Heroku."
