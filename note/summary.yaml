    heading: "### Questions 

        Every day people commute from Augsburg to Munich. Every week
        some traffic accidents happen on Autobahn 8. Which part of the
        highway is most dangerous? Which direction is more dangerous,
        driving to or returning from Munich? At what time?  In what
        road condition? In order to make the investigation fast and
        intuitive, a dashboard is created.  One can compare the
        distributions of the accidents along A8 in different
        (combinations of) conditions."


    conclusion: "### Conclusion 

        1. There are a few obvious anomalies that one can quickly recognize. 

        - excessive accidents between **Sulzemoos** and **Odelzhausen** 
          on the **return trip** from Munich. 

        - excessive accidents between **Adelzhausen** and **Odelzshausen** 
          on the way **to go** to Munich. 

        - excessive accidents between **Sulzemoos** and **Dreieck MÃ¼nchen**
          on the way **to go** to Munich. 


        In either case, such excessive accidents are not seen on the
        route in the opposite direction. The tendency can be seen in
        all years that the data are collected. If we close up
        individual accident site, it seems the most of the accidents 
        happens on the passing lane. 


        2. There are more than 40,000 combinations of filtering, just
        counting the options that we picked up here. A quick web
        app/dashboard is a good option to perform **intuitive
        investigations**."

    what: "### What this App Does

        1. Collect the accidents data from UnfallAtlas website in csv
           format.

        2. Clean-up the data (the collections of the data are slightly
           different each year).

        3. Get the coordinates on A8 (tracks up to, and down from
           Munich, separately) using OSRM service (see 'Data Source /
           Services Used')

        4. Calculate the distances between an accident site and the A8
           up/down tracks to identify on which track (= the direction
           of the flow on the highway) the accident happened.

        5. Use the data collected on 3., and convert the latitudes and
           the longitude of the accident sites to one dimensional
           distance, i.e., the distance from the entrance of A8 (in
           our case AS Zusmarshausen).

        6. Aggregate the data as histogram, heat map, and bar chart.

        7. Show the figures and the maps on a dashboard using
           `streamlit`.  Add controls to filter the types of accidents
           using streamlit API.

        8. Deploy the App on Heroku."
